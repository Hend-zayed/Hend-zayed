- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hend-zayed
- ðŸ‘€ I have experience in data analysis with python using different libraries to gather, wrangle, explore, and visualize the data.
        * gathering the dataset from various sources like CSV files, excel sheets, APIs,JSON, and using web scraping.
        * wrangling the data via assessing them to find the missing and outlier data and correct them.
        * exploring the data to find patterns and meaningful statistics.
        * drawing various visual results of the data to make decisions.
